24-MB01,Review,3,"I use it a lot ",It's a good size and I use it a lot. My only issue with it was I wanted the handles to be longer so I can wear it on my back.,Filiberto,
24-MB02,Review,5,I've had this thing for a long time,"I've had this thing for a really long time and it barely shows any signs of wear and tear. It's really big, too! I've taken it on day trips as well as short vacations and usually have no trouble finding room for my stuff.",Herb,""
24-MB02,Review,3,Decent bag,"Decent bag. I keep my stuff in it for work and the gym. It's nice and roomy. I wish it had a more sophisticated design, though. Kinda looks like it's for kids.",Craig,""
